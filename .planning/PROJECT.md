# STOA Frontend

## What This Is

STOA Frontend is the React + TypeScript + Vite frontend for the STOA learning platform. The project now has a stable development foundation, visible product UI, and a backend-integrated student chat flow for real conversation data.

The app includes a STOA core product UI with a backend-driven student chat workspace, conversation list, message flow, teacher-help request path, streaming assistant responses, homework file uploads, and a mock student learning dashboard. The current product step is adding real user identity boundaries, role-specific dashboards, parent learning visibility, tutor help-request handling, and a local SQLite-backed test backend.

## Core Value

Developers can clone `stoa-frontend`, run the npm scripts, and use a credible STOA education platform workflow with authenticated role boundaries backed only by the unified STOA backend API contract.

## Current Milestone: v1.5 Phase 6 Authentication, User Roles, and Parent Visibility

**Goal:** Upgrade STOA from a single-user learning prototype into an education platform with real user identity, role-specific access, parent visibility, tutor help-request handling, and a SQLite-backed local test backend.

**Target features:**
- Login, register, logout, current-user hydration, local token storage, and 401/403 handling.
- Student, Parent, Tutor, and Admin roles with protected routes and role guards.
- Role-specific dashboards, layouts, and navigation.
- Student profile editing and student learning history.
- Parent child list, child learning summary, recent questions, weak topics, and child learning-history visibility.
- Tutor help-request list, detail view, and status updates.
- Local FastAPI + SQLite test backend with users, roles, profiles, conversations, messages, uploads metadata, teacher help requests, learning history, and seed data.
- README documentation for authentication, roles, permissions, and local SQLite testing.

## Current State

**Latest shipped milestone:** v1.4 Phase 5 Streaming Chat, File Upload, and Real Learning Workflow

**Delivered product surface:**
- `/chat` mock product UI with conversation sidebar, active message list, message bubbles, chat input, upload placeholder, AI thinking state, delayed mock response, and teacher-help placeholder.
- `/chat` backend-integrated product UI with conversation list/detail queries, create-conversation, send-message, teacher-help request, and API state handling.
- `/chat` streaming product UI with optimistic student messages, streaming assistant placeholders, stop generation, failed-message retry, attachment upload/preview, attachment-aware sends, and stateful teacher-help status display.
- `/dashboard` mock student learning overview with stats, recent questions, weak topics, learning progress, and teacher feedback.
- Mock chat/dashboard contracts and data under `src/types/` and `src/data/`.
- README documentation for Phase 3 Core Product UI.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Git repository exists for `stoa-frontend` — existing
- ✓ React + TypeScript + Vite dependency foundation exists in `package.json` — existing
- ✓ Initial role route shell exists under `src/pages/**` — existing, but outside Phase 1 scope
- ✓ Basic Cognito/Amplify, Axios, TanStack Query, and Zustand scaffolding exists — existing, but outside Phase 1 scope
- ✓ GSD codebase map exists in `.planning/codebase/` — existing
- ✓ Developers can install, run, build, lint, preview, and inspect the minimal STOA frontend foundation — v1.0
- ✓ Frontend development foundation exists with TailwindCSS, UI primitives, routing, providers, services, stores, layouts, pages, theme notes, and docs — v1.1
- ✓ Developers can run the app and demo mock STOA chat plus student dashboard product UI — v1.2
- ✓ Developers can run the app and exercise STOA chat through the unified backend Chat API contract — v1.3
- ✓ Developers can run the app and exercise a streaming STOA chat workflow with file attachments and teacher-help status through the unified backend API contract — v1.4

### Active

- [ ] Users can register, log in, stay authenticated across refresh, and log out through the frontend Auth flow.
- [ ] Student, Parent, Tutor, and Admin users see only role-appropriate routes, navigation, dashboards, and data.
- [ ] Students can manage their profile and see their own learning history while chat data remains scoped to the current user.
- [ ] Parents can view bound children, child summaries, recent learning activity, weak topics, teacher-help records, and learning-history summaries.
- [ ] Tutors can view and update teacher help requests with necessary student question context.
- [ ] A local FastAPI + SQLite test backend supports auth, role-filtered data access, seed accounts, conversations, messages, file metadata, teacher help requests, and learning history.
- [ ] README documents Phase 6 auth, roles, API endpoints, and local SQLite testing.

### Out of Scope

- Production SSO, email verification, password reset completion, refresh-token architecture, and httpOnly cookie migration — Phase 6 uses MVP auth with local token storage.
- Complex school organization, parent invitation, and full admin management — Phase 6 keeps role surfaces minimal.
- Real multi-person teacher chat — Phase 6 supports tutor help-request list/detail/status, not live teacher chat.
- Payment system — billing and subscriptions are deferred.
- Production deployment — hosting and CI/CD are deferred.
- Direct frontend calls to OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Codex, or any other model provider — frontend remains coupled only to STOA backend APIs.
- Production SQLite usage — SQLite is local functional-test infrastructure only; production persistence remains a backend concern.
- Full audit logging and Swiss data privacy compliance documentation — deferred until later security/compliance milestones.

## Context

The project brief for Phase 6 was provided in Chinese and defines authentication, role boundaries, parent visibility, tutor help-request handling, and a local SQLite-backed test backend. It builds on v1.4's streaming chat, upload, retry, new-conversation, and teacher-help status workflow while establishing who can use the system and what each role can see.

Recommended baseline technology:
- React for long-term frontend scalability.
- TypeScript for team collaboration and safer changes.
- Vite for fast development startup and lightweight configuration.
- npm as the default package manager.
- GitHub as the shared repository host, expected at `https://github.com/stoasystem/stoa-frontend`.

Current codebase facts:
- v1.0 shipped the minimal STOA Vite app.
- v1.1 shipped TailwindCSS, shadcn-style UI primitives, routing, providers, API services, stores, layouts, common components, and documentation.
- v1.2 shipped the first mock product UI for `/chat` and `/dashboard`.
- v1.3 shipped backend-integrated `/chat` data flow using TanStack Query and Axios API services.
- v1.4 shipped the Phase 5 real learning workflow: streaming response handling, upload attachments, retry, stop generation, new conversation flow, and teacher-help status progression.
- During the testing stage, the backend may use Codex as a temporary AI provider behind its own provider layer. The frontend must not depend on provider-specific APIs or environment variables.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite, npm — specified by the Phase 1 project brief.
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 LTS or newer LTS is recommended for local development.
- **Scope**: Phase 6 adds authentication, role routing, local backend persistence, parent visibility, and tutor help-request handling; complex organizations, live teacher chat, payments, production SSO, and deployment stay out of scope.
- **Model providers**: The frontend must call only the STOA backend API; Codex usage during testing belongs behind the backend provider layer.
- **Local backend**: FastAPI is expected at `http://localhost:8000` during local integration, with frontend dev server at `http://localhost:5173`.
- **Streaming**: The frontend supports SSE/fetch streaming from the backend and must not call provider-specific streaming APIs directly.
- **Uploads**: Phase 5 supports PNG, JPEG, and PDF homework uploads up to 10 MB per file and at most 3 pending attachments per send.
- **Auth token storage**: Phase 6 may use `localStorage` key `stoa_access_token`; production hardening is deferred.
- **SQLite**: SQLite is only for local functional testing behind a local backend API; the browser frontend must never read SQLite directly.
- **Permissions**: Frontend route guards are user-experience protection only; backend APIs must enforce real user and role data filtering.
- **Repository hygiene**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and local env files must not be committed.
- **Developer workflow**: The project must be usable through standard npm scripts.
- **GitHub**: The intended remote is `https://github.com/stoasystem/stoa-frontend`, but remote setup depends on repository access and should be verified before push.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use React + TypeScript + Vite | Matches the Phase 1 brief and gives a fast, maintainable frontend base | — Pending |
| Use npm | Default toolchain is simple for team members | — Pending |
| Keep Phase 1 as foundation-only | Prevents premature feature work before the repo can run and build cleanly | — Pending |
| Treat existing role/API/auth scaffolding as non-Phase-1 context | The current repo includes later-stage placeholders, but Phase 1 acceptance is only the foundation | — Pending |
| Complete v1.0 before expanding product features | Foundation commands and handoff documentation now pass, so later milestones can build on a stable base | ✓ Good |
| Continue phase numbering into v1.1 | Keeps GSD history continuous across milestones | ✓ Good |
| Use shadcn-style local UI components | Provides copyable, customizable primitives without coupling future work to opaque component packages | ✓ Good |
| Continue phase numbering into v1.2 | Keeps GSD history continuous across frontend foundation and product UI milestones | ✓ Good |
| Keep Phase 3 mock-driven | Lets the team demo the core student experience before backend contracts are ready | ✓ Good |
| Keep chat/dashboard components props-driven | Makes Phase 4 API replacement possible without rewriting UI modules | ✓ Good |
| Continue phase numbering into v1.3 | Keeps GSD history continuous; Phase 4 product work will use GSD Phase 11+ execution numbers | ✓ Good |
| Keep model-provider calls behind the backend | Lets testing use Codex now and swap providers later without frontend contract churn | — Pending |
| Use non-streaming HTTP responses for Phase 4 chat replies | Proves the backend data path before adding streaming complexity in Phase 5 | — Pending |
| Add create-conversation support in empty chat state | Prevents first-time users from hitting a dead end when the backend returns no conversations | ✓ Good |
| Use fetch for streaming chat | Browser ReadableStream handling is simpler through fetch than Axios | — Pending |
| Keep token-level streaming state local to React | Avoids high-frequency global Zustand updates and keeps canonical data in TanStack Query | — Pending |
| Treat uploaded files as backend attachment metadata | Keeps OCR/PDF parsing behind backend APIs and lets frontend send only attachment IDs | — Pending |
| Use localStorage for Phase 6 access tokens | Simple MVP token persistence is enough to validate role workflows before production auth hardening | — Pending |
| Add a local FastAPI + SQLite test backend | Lets frontend auth, role filtering, and learning-data workflows be tested before the formal backend is ready | — Pending |
| Treat frontend route guards as non-security boundaries | Prevents UI checks from replacing backend authorization and keeps data isolation enforced by APIs | — Pending |
